# Gate Application

## Building Circuits

A circuit is a `Vector` of gates to be applied sequentially. Each gate is specified as a tuple `(gate_string, vertices, parameter)` or `(gate_string, vertices)` if no parameter is associated with that gate. For gates that take more than one parameter (e.g. `"xx_plus_yy"`), pass a tuple: `(gate_string, vertices, (θ, β))`.

```julia
layer = []
# Single-site rotations
append!(layer, ("Rx", [v], 2 * hx * dt) for v in vertices(g))
append!(layer, ("Rz", [v], 2 * hz * dt) for v in vertices(g))

# Two-site gates, grouped by edge coloring for maximum BP update efficiency when using `apply_gates`
ec = edge_color(g, 4)  # 4 = coordination number of the square lattice
for colored_edges in ec
    append!(layer, ("Rzz", pair, 2 * J * dt) for pair in colored_edges)
end
```

### Edge Coloring

The `edge_color` function partitions edges into groups of non-overlapping edges. Non-overlapping gates within a group are applied without requiring intermediate BP cache updates, which is significantly more efficient. An edge coloring into `k` groups is always possible on a bipartite graph of degree `k` so in that case the second argument should be the coordination number (maximum vertex degree) of the graph:

```julia
ec = edge_color(g, 4)   # square lattice (degree 4)
ec = edge_color(g, 3)   # hexagonal / heavy-hex lattice (degree 3)
ec = edge_color(g, 6)   # 3D cubic lattice (degree 6)
```

## Applying Gates

Apply gates to a `TensorNetworkState` or a `BeliefPropagationCache`:

```julia
apply_kwargs = (; maxdim = 10, cutoff = 1e-10, normalize_tensors = true)

# Apply to a TensorNetworkState (constructs a BP cache internally)
ψ, errors = apply_gates(circuit, ψ; apply_kwargs)

# Apply to a BeliefPropagationCache (reuses existing messages)
ψ_bpc = BeliefPropagationCache(ψ)
ψ_bpc, errors = apply_gates(circuit, ψ_bpc; apply_kwargs)
```

### Keyword Arguments

- `apply_kwargs`: A `NamedTuple` controlling bond dimension truncation:
  - `maxdim`: Maximum bond dimension after SVD truncation.
  - `cutoff`: Singular value cutoff for truncation.
  - `normalize_tensors`: Whether to locally normalize tensors after each gate application (recommended for numerical stability).
- `bp_update_kwargs`: Keyword arguments controlling the BP message update between overlapping gate groups.
- `update_cache`: Whether to update BP messages between gate groups (default `true`).

### Return Values

`apply_gates` returns a tuple `(ψ_updated, errors)` where:
- `ψ_updated` is the updated state (or cache).
- `errors` is a vector of truncation errors, one per gate.

The product `prod(1 .- errors)` gives a lower bound on the fidelity accumulated across all gate applications.

## Simple Update Algorithm

Under the hood, each two-site gate is applied via the _simple update_ algorithm [[Jiang2008]](index.md#references) [[Tindall2024]](index.md#references):

1. Gauge the state locally using the square roots of the BP environment messages.
2. Perform a QR decomposition to efficiently isolate the two `R` tensors.
3. Apply the gate.
4. Perform an SVD and truncate the singular values to the desired bond dimension.
5. Multiply the `Q` tensors back in and ungauge the state with the inverse square root messages.
6. Update the BP messages (both directions) on the affected bond with the singular value matrix `S`.

Single-site gates are applied by direct contraction with the site tensor (no truncation needed). If the gate is unitary the BP messages will be unchanged.

## Supported Gates

All parameterised gates follow the qiskit convention. The canonical names below
are case-sensitive; the **Alias** column gives the qiskit-style lowercase name
that is also accepted, where a qiskit equivalent exists. Gates without a qiskit
equivalent are marked `—`.

### One-qubit Gates

| Gate | Alias | Parameter | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `"X"`, `"Y"`, `"Z"` | `"x"`, `"y"`, `"z"` | -- | Pauli gates |
| `"H"` | `"h"` | -- | Hadamard |
| `"P"` | `"p"` | phase | Phase gate |
| `"Rx"`, `"Ry"`, `"Rz"` | `"rx"`, `"ry"`, `"rz"` | angle | Pauli rotation |
| `"CRx"`, `"CRy"`, `"CRz"` | `"crx"`, `"cry"`, `"crz"` | angle | Controlled Pauli rotation (single-qubit part) |

### Two-qubit Gates

| Gate | Alias | Parameter | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `"CNOT"`, `"CX"` | `"cnot"`, `"cx"` | -- | Controlled-X (qiskit name is `"cx"`; `"cnot"` is a convenience alias) |
| `"CY"`, `"CZ"` | `"cy"`, `"cz"` | -- | Controlled-Y / Z |
| `"SWAP"`, `"iSWAP"` | `"swap"`, `"iswap"` | -- | SWAP / iSWAP |
| `"√SWAP"`, `"√iSWAP"` | — | -- | Square-root SWAP variants (no qiskit equivalent) |
| `"Rxx"`, `"Ryy"`, `"Rzz"` | `"rxx"`, `"ryy"`, `"rzz"` | angle | Pauli-pair rotations |
| `"Rxxyy"`, `"Rxxyyzz"` | — | angle | XX+YY and XX+YY+ZZ rotations (no qiskit equivalent) |
| `"xx_plus_yy"` | (canonical) | (angle, phase) | XX+YY interaction with relative phase (qiskit `XXPlusYYGate`) |
| `"CPHASE"` | `"cp"` | phase | Controlled phase (qiskit name is `"cp"`) |

### Custom Gates

There are two paths for using a gate that isn't in the built-in registry, depending on whether the gate is one-off or reusable.

#### Path 1: Pass an `ITensor` directly

For a one-off gate, build the `ITensor` yourself from the physical site indices and pass it to `apply_gates`. No registration needed:

```julia
using ITensors: ITensor

s = siteinds(ψ)
# Custom gates
gate1 = ITensor(my_local_matrix, s[v1], s[v1]')
gate2 = ITensor(my_nn_gate, s[v1], s[v2], s[v1]', s[v2]')
ψ, errors = apply_gates([gate1, gate2], ψ; apply_kwargs)
```

#### Path 2: Register a named gate

For a gate you'll reuse repeatedly, register it once and then use the tuple form like any built-in. Two steps:

1. Define the matrix as an `ITensors.op` method.
2. Call [`register_gate!`](@ref) to tell the dispatcher which keyword arguments your `op` accepts.

```julia
using ITensors: op, OpName, SiteType, Index

# 1. Define the matrix (the "physics" part)
function ITensors.op(::OpName"FSim", ::SiteType"S=1/2", s1::Index, s2::Index;
                     θ::Number, ϕ::Number)
    # ... return a 4-leg ITensor ...
end

# 2. Register the dispatch info (the "name → kwargs" part)
register_gate!("FSim"; paramkeys = (:θ, :ϕ))

# 3. Use it in circuits like any built-in
circuit = [("FSim", [v1, v2], (π/4, π/8))]
ψ, _ = apply_gates(circuit, ψ)
```

The keyword arguments map as:

- `paramkeys = (:θ, :ϕ)` — names of the kwargs your `op` expects, in the order they appear in the circuit-tuple parameter. For a single-parameter gate, use a 1-tuple like `(:θ,)`.
- `opname = "FSim"` — defaults to the gate name; override if your circuit-level name should differ from the `OpName` your `op` uses.
- `rescale = identity` — applied to the parameter(s) before forwarding to `op`. Useful when your `op` follows a different convention (e.g., the built-in `"Rxx"` uses `rescale = θ -> θ/2` to bridge our qiskit convention to ITensors').

To add a qiskit-style alias for your gate (so e.g. `"fsim"` resolves to `"FSim"`), call [`register_alias!`](@ref):

```julia
register_alias!("fsim", "FSim")
```

!!! note "Persistence"
    `register_gate!` and `register_alias!` mutate an in-memory dictionary and only persist for the current Julia session. To re-register on every startup, put the calls at the top of your script, or in your downstream package's `__init__()` function.

!!! note "Built-ins are locked"
    The gates listed in the tables above are protected: `register_gate!` and `unregister_gate!` both refuse to operate on a built-in name. You can freely add new gates and aliases, and overwrite gates you registered yourself, but the library's own canonical entries cannot be mutated through this API.
